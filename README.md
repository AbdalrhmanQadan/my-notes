### Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. A “bad developer” is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity. A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

## Complexity
### Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. 

## Maintenance
### Maintenance is one of the most important things in software . Note that the code needs maintenance in the future As a developer, thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities. All changes require maintenance.

## Consistency Consistency is a big part of simplicity

## Prioritizing
* The desirability of a change: How much do you want that change to happen?
* The value of a change: How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
* The effort required to perform the change: How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?
## The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

## Solving Problems
### The first step is understanding. Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them. Write down your problem and try to explain it to someone else.
